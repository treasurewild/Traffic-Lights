# What I Learned from this Project

I'm still new to full-stack projects. If you look through the commits for this one you'll see that, and you'll hopefully see some of the progress I've made in my own understanding too.

## Goals

The key goal in designing Traffic Lights was a learning exercise. I didn't set out to use perfect programming practice, to use Agile, to follow good Test-Driven Development processes, or to make perfect use of a project board, or anything else for that matter. I think we forget that in learning exercises sometimes.

If my teaching taught me nothing else it's that deliberate, isolated practice is vital to progressing your understanding. I've come to think of my own mind as a simple computer, it has a hard-drive, it has RAM and it can save to the cloud (i.e. make bookmarks in Chrome). When learning new concepts the RAM fills up fast, and it takes time to embed some of that understanding and save it to the hard-drive. OK, so the analogy might not marry up perfectly with how digital memory works, but the point is that until you've been able to index that new knowledge, and form some links to your existing knowledge, you're operating only with that RAM. We've all had that experience of walking away from a problem, and given a few minutes of headspace the solution becomes clear. Your brain works like a muscle, and it needs recovery time.

With that in mind I wanted to make sure I isolated different parts of the project. The first step was that I wasn't going to follow Write-A-Test -> Pass-The-Test style. I wanted my code to be tested thoroughly, but I also needed time to understand how to do this properly, and also I needed to avoid being distracted from the new things I was learning. So I've tried to chunk this process, writing blocks of tests as a separate task. I'm still learning about whether the testing Ive done is meaningful or useful though.

## New Things

Lots of parts of this project used things I was already familiar with, but very little I can consider myself to have mastered. I find I'm often misunderstood when I use the word 'Mastered' in a programming context, with people forever telling me 'You'll never stop learning!' I know, and that's great, I love learning new things, but when I talk about Mastery in this context I mean tasks that I have been able to embed in my long-term memory, so that I'm not using that RAM any more. 

If you've ever learned a musical instrument, or to juggle, the distinction hopefully becomes clear. Once you've embedded that learning it becomes automatic, if only for that song, or that juggling sequence. It might even get to the stage where you don't consciously remember what you're doing. In these early days this kind of Mastery is at a micro level for me. Can I write an onClick handler for that button? Can I make the right API request to delete a document? It's something I find hugely satisfying, knowing that I'm making small pieces of progress with these things.

I've also learned more concrete skills during the development. The difference between async-await and then-able functions for example, or how to use Sockets to share information with multiple users at once. I've learned more about how to pass meaningful messages about API requests, so that users get feedback that informs what they do next. I think you can only really learn lots of these things through play and experimentation.
